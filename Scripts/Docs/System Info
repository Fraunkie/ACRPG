## 🧠 Overview

**Animecraft RPG** is a fully custom **Warcraft III Reforged** map merging multiple anime universes into one connected world.  
You awaken as a lost soul in **HFIL** — the “Home For Infinite Losers” — after the catastrophic **Great Convergence** tore rifts across worlds.  
From there, you’ll rebuild your power, earn your life back, and ascend through universes.

## ⚔️ Gameplay Highlights

### 🕊️ The Soul & Spirit Systems
- **Soul Energy** – your XP system inspired by RuneScape. Earned **only on kill**, not per hit.  
- **Spirit Drive** – a rage-like meter that fills on combat hits (+8 per hit default) and drains OOC.  
  When full, it enables Ascension, special skills, or ultimate bursts.

### 💀 HFIL – Starting Zone
- Tutorial hub led by **King Yemma**.  
- Learn Souls, Fragments, and Threat mechanics.  
- Souls = progression XP → raise Power Level → unlock new zones.

### 💎 Fragments & Shards
- Duplicate Shards convert to **Fragments** (main currency).  
- Each family (Saiyan, Namekian, Pokémon, etc.) has unique Shards & Ascension paths.  
- Charged Shards are consumed at **Ascension Gates** to transform heroes.

### 🔮 Ascension Gates
- Require Charged Shard + Tier + Power Level + Full Spirit Drive.  
- Grant temporary buff packages and permanent unlocks.  
- Each Gate features cinematic FX and timed challenges.

### ⚔️ Combat & Threat
- **ThreatSystem** tracks per-unit aggro like WoW, with decay and healing threat.  
- **AggroManager** links packs and handles AI taunts or assists.  
- **CombatHUD** shows target threat list and group average DPS.

### 💰 Loot & Economy
- **Shared Loot:** each player in the threat group gets personal drops.  
- **Roll Chest:** rare items spawn shared rollable chests for timed rolls.  
- **Fragments** = main economy; **Soul Energy** = progression XP.  
- If inventory is full, loot auto-routes to the **Bag Follower Unit** (ignored in combat).

## 🧩 Development Workflow

### Total Initialization
Every system runs inside `OnInit.final()` — **load order no longer matters.**

### Centralized Chat Commands
All dev and test commands live in `ChatTriggerRegistry.lua` for clean maintenance.

### Threat & AI Integration
`ThreatSystem` and `AggroManager` cooperate to decide:
- Which target each mob attacks  
- When packs assist or reset  
- When AI switches target based on Threat ratios  

### Loot System Bridge
`CombatEventsBridge` → Loot systems → drops items to heroes or Bag.  
Shared rolls display winner to all and announce via UI toast.

## 🧠 Technical Summary
- 100 % Lua with Total Initialization.  
- No `%` in strings (uses concatenation).  
- No top-level natives — FourCC runs inside `OnInit.final`.  
- Fully editor-safe (WC3 syntax & save).  
- Modular and hot-reloadable via InitBroker system.
