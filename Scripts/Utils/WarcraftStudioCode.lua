    =============================================================================================================================================================

    WSCode.Parse(functionBody)                      Parses the provided code, searching for function definitions to generate function previews, then executes the
                                                    code in chunks delimited by either Debug.beginFile or @beginFile tokens, which must be followed by the script
                                                    name. Parsed scripts can be added to the editor with the Pull Script button. A script will automatically be
                                                    transpiled into debug form and added to the editor if a @debug token is found anywhere in the script. Designed
                                                    to read in the entire map script by creating a wrapper starting with WSCode.Parse([===[ and ending with ]===]).
    WSCode.AddBreakPoint(whichTab, lineNumber)      Adds a breakpoint to a line in the specified tab. The tab can be referenced either by its tab index or its name.
    WSCode.BreakHere()                              Halts exeuction of the code when it reaches this line and switches to the tab it is executed in. Script must be
                                                    compiled in debug mode. A breakpoint added this way cannot be disabled.
    WSCode.Show(enable)                             Shows or hides the code editor.
    WSCode.IsEnabled()                              Returns whether the code editor has been created.
    WSCode.IsVisible()                              Returns whether the code editor is visible.
    WSCode.IsExpanded()                             Returns whether the code editor is expanded.



    WSCode initializers execute a function at a specified point in the map loading process, allowing you to initialize your scripts in a safe and ordered way.
    The initialization points take inspiration from TotalInitialization, mapping the same suffixes to the same initialization points.

    Functions are added to the initializer list in the same order as they are encountered by the Parser. Therefore, the @require command governs both the order of
    the script execution in the Lua root as well as the order of the initializer functions. In the rare cases where you need additional control over the order of
    execution, you can add the optional onWhichPass parameter. If a pass is set to N > 1, the initializer list is looped through multiple times and the function
    for which the pass was set is only executed on the Nth iteration.

    WSCode.InitMain(whichFunc, onWhichPass?)        Called before main. The earliest point to initialize outside the Lua root.
    WSCode.InitGlobal(whichFunc, onWhichPass?)      Called after InitGlobals. The standard point to initialize.
    WSCode.InitTrig(whichFunc, onWhichPass?)        Called after InitCustomTriggers. Useful for removing hooks that should only apply to GUI events.
    WSCode.InitMap(whichFunc, onWhichPass?)         Called at the last point in initialization before the loading screen is completed.
    WSCode.InitFinal(whichFunc, onWhichPass?)       Called immediately after the loading screen has disappeared, and the game has started.
    WSCode.InitEssential(whichFunc, onWhichPass?)   Called immediately before InitFinal. Will execute even if initialization was halted.
