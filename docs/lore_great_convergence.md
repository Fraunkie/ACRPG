# 🌌 Animecraft RPG — Lore Codex: The Great Convergence

## Overview
Long ago, the walls between worlds began to thin. Magic, ki, chakra, and digital code — all vibrating on different frequencies — started to resonate as one. When their harmonies aligned, reality cracked.  

This event became known as **The Great Convergence**: the moment all universes collided. Time folded in on itself. Worlds from every story were drawn into a single cosmic storm.

## The Shattered Realms
Each realm — Dragon Ball’s afterlife, Pokémon’s forests, Digimon’s digital seas, Naruto’s elemental nations — was torn from its foundation and fused along the edges of a massive rift.  

The **vortex** became the center of everything: a spiraling wound of raw energy where lost souls, data fragments, and forgotten powers mix endlessly. It is from this storm that the shards were born — **crystallized memories** of strength and legend.

## Yemma’s Bureau on the Edge
When the Convergence hit, **King Yemma’s Bureau** — the gateway of judgment and reincarnation — was ripped from its moorings in the spirit realm.  
Instead of collapsing into oblivion, the Bureau was caught in the event’s gravity well and stabilized at the edge of the vortex — half tethered to order, half suspended over chaos.  

Now, its great desk overlooks the swirling void below: a monument of bureaucracy turned into the last checkpoint between life, death, and everything else.  

Here, Yemma still does his work — what’s left of it. The ledgers are ashes, the queues stretch into infinity, and the souls keep coming.

## The Lost Spirits (Players)
Every player begins as a **wandering spirit**, flung into this fractured afterlife.  
Drawn to Yemma’s Bureau, they’re offered a chance: take form, reclaim fragments of memory, and carve a new fate in this merged reality.  

Your hero’s “soul energy” is what keeps you from fading into the storm. The stronger it grows, the more of your past and potential returns.

## Shards and Fragments
Throughout the worlds, **Shards** lie buried — relics from before the Convergence, holding the essence of fallen heroes.  
Collecting them restores echoes of those powers.  
Duplicates become **Fragments**, the raw spiritual currency that rebuilds you piece by piece.

---

## The New Order
The Bureau now acts as the central hub between the broken worlds:
- **HFIL (Home For Infinite Losers):** Where all spirits first emerge — a wasteland of wandering souls.  
- **Yemma’s Desk:** The last bastion of law, balanced precariously at the edge of the vortex.  
- **Teleport Nodes:** Fragments of stability that let the brave travel between the realms.  
- **The Ascension Gates:** Where shards awaken and power returns.  

The Great Convergence may have ended the old order — but it gave rise to this one.
